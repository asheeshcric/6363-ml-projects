## k-Means Clustering

### Dependencies Required
- python>=3.6
- numpy, matplotlib
- pip3 install numpy matplotlib

### Steps to run the code
- Please make sure that the data file `iris.data` is in the following relative path from the main code file: `data/iris.data`. The data file is included with the zipped file in case you run it directly from the downloaded folder.
- Command to run the code: `python3 k_means.py`

### NOTES
- Figures are saved in the same directory where the code file exists as 3-clusters.png, 5-clusters.png, and 7-clusters.png
- The `k_means.pdf` file is extracted from the notebook where I experimented with the algorithm along with its outputs. So, you can refer to that pdf to see how I approached the problem.
- I selected the number of clusters to be either 3 or 5 (based on the availability of the labels -- explained in the report in detail)
