Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\n', b'stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\n', b'He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\n', b'technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\n', b'remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n', b'\\n', b'\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\n', b'A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\n', b'remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\n', b'deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\n', b'unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n', b'\\n', b'\"A Maze of Death\"\\n', b'Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n', b'\\n', b'\"VALIS\"\\n', b'The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\n', b'Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\n', b'unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\n', b'dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n', b'\\n', b'\"The Divine Invasion\"\\n', b'God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\n', b'another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\n', b'assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n', b'\\n', b'MARGARET ATWOOD\\n', b'\\n', b'\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\n', b'A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\n', b'assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n', b'\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\n', b\"under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\\n\", b'and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\n', b'radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\n', b'retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\n', b\"hunted down and hanged.

In this\\n', b'work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\n', b'existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\n', b'upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\n', b'aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\n', b'decisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

MACKIE\\n', b'\\n', b'\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\n', b'This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\n', b'arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\n', b'philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\n', b'the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\n', b'of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\n', b'positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\n', b'such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\n', b'God\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.
